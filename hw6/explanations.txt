We know that the server response error 500 if the token is wrong and 200 if right.

Then, we create an alphabet of a,b,c,...,1,2,3,..
To submit the token, we need it to be in a Json form. 
Then:
def submit_token(host, token):
	start_time = time.time()
	r = requests.post(host, json={
		'token': token
	})
	end_time = time.time()
	elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
	return r, elapsed_time
we create an empty char : current_token = ''

and we want to fill it with the good caracters of the token. 

To do so, we need the padding character ( alphabet[0]).
The size of the final token is 12
after that, we loop on every single caracter in the alphabet and try to submit it 
so, the token will be : car1, padding *11 
then : car1,car2, padding *10, ...
We know that if the car1 is the good one, then the response will be 200. we store it in current_token
We redo this procedure until size of current_token =12
