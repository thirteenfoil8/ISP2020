Download and run container:
    docker run --rm -it -p 5001:5001 --name hw5ex1 com402/hw5ex1
Accesing DB:
    Access the container directly with: docker exec -it hw5ex1 /bin/bash
    Access the database with: mysql -u<username> -p<password>    
    The credentials are stored in the /root/credentials.cfg file.


Exercise 2
----------
Copying file from container to the host: 
    docker cp hw5ex2:site.py site.py
Aliases are ready in aliases.sh (run it with "source aliases.sh"),
they can be used in order to save time.

Run new site.py:
    chmod +x site.py
    ./site.py
But this will fail for some reason, to fix this run "sh startup.sh" from the container once, no need
to rerun it after adding every new site.py.
